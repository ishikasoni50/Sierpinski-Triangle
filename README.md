# Sierpinski-Triangle
The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal pattern in which a triangle (usually an equilateral triangle) is inscribed with three smaller triangles. This pattern is repeated within each new set of triangles, creating a complex image. However, if the image is examined closely—if you zoom in on a part of the Triangle—you will see the same image repeated over again.
