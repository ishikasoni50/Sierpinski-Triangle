# Sierpinski-Triangle
Project for IAE 101 (SBU)

The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal pattern in which a triangle (usually an equilateral triangle) is inscribed with three smaller triangles. This pattern is repeated within each new set of triangles, creating a complex image. However, if the image is examined closely—if you zoom in on a part of the Triangle—you will see the same image repeated over again.

The Sierpinski Triangle, also known as the Sierpinski Sieve or the Siepinski Gasket, is named after Waclaw Sierpinski, a Polish Mathematician (1882 – 1969) who described the pattern, or set of steps, for constructing it in 1915. However, the pattern appears in Western art as early as the 13th Century.
